I couldn't find a file-haring app that ticked all the boxes I'm interested in ü§î: files are shared in a fast & secure way ‚ö°, sharing any type of file, any size of file, from my laptop/pc to any device, having cross-platform support with pretty interface, no ads please and most important among all no need to have the same app installed on the receiving end , enabling convenient, hassle free sharing experience.

So I built my own. üòÉ

## Features

### The Lighting Bolt ‚ö°

Open-source file sharing app with fast cross-platform transfer speed, free of online feeds. Enables sharing files including photos, videos, music, contacts, apps and any other files, no matter of what size.

### Share with anyone üíªüì±

Share files from your laptop/personal-computer with any type of client, let it be another laptop/personal-computer or mobile devices. No matter what OS they are operating on.

When I used to use apps like SHAREIt, to transfer files from my laptop to mobile/another-laptop it required that it's app to be installed on both the devices i.e., on sender & receiver, this created hurdles for sharing conveniently.

Having JustShareIt installed on both ends is not required. Only the sender needs to have it installed. Receiver can access the shared files using any convient browser on their devices upon sharing approval from the sender.
