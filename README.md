I couldn't find a file-haring app that ticked all the boxes I'm interested in ü§î: files are shared fast & securely ‚ö°, sharing any type of file, any size of file, from my laptop/pc to any device, having cross-platform support with pretty interface, no one can access the app except me (SHAREIt allowed it though ü§®), no ads please and no need to have the same app installed on the receiving end , enabling convenient, hassle free sharing experience.

So I built my own. üòÉ

## Features

### The Lighting Bolt ‚ö°

Open-source sharing app with fast cross-platform transfer speed, free of online feeds. Enables sharing files including photos, videos, music, contacts, apps and any other files, no matter of what size.

</p>

### No room to waste üì¶

Files to be shared are simply not stored on your disk, this is extremely storage friendly, unlike conventional apps some space is required to store the files first on app storage and then share them with the receiver.

</p>

### Share with anyone üíªüì±

Share files from your laptop/personal-computer with any type of client, let it be another laptop/personal-computer or mobile devices. No matter what OS they are operating on.

When I used to use SHAREIt, to transfer files from my laptop to mobile/another-laptop it required that it's app to be installed on both the devices i.e., on sender & receiver, this created hurdles for sharing conveniently.

Having JustShareIt installed on both ends is not required. Only the sender needs to have it installed. Receiver can access the shared files using any convient browser on their devices upon sharing approval from the sender.

### JustKeepItSecure üîê

No one, except you can access JustShareIt for sharing files from your system with anyone.

- For Windows/MacOS
	- Download & Install **Docker Toolbox**
		- for macOS instructions are [here](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/).
		- for Windows instructions are [here](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/).
- For Ubuntu

- Download or clone your forked repository
	- You can clone the repository executing below command in a location of your choice of your system.

	- Adding a "-r" argument like ```$ stop.sh -r```, cleans all the app containers & volume mounts, and reset the app to default configurations.
	- Executing the above command without "-r", simply stops all services and don't reset to default.
- To restart the app, (while the app is still running) use the following command
```$ sh restart.sh```
	- Adding a "-r" argument like ```$ restart.sh -r```, cleans all the app containers & volume mounts, and reset the app to default configurations and then start the servcies again.
